# 🌐 Emmanuel the Analyst – Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This space is dedicated to showcasing my growing body of work in **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**.

As I continue to build real-world projects across data analytics and reporting, this site will serve as a central hub where I share:

- Cleaned and transformed datasets using SQL
- Interactive dashboards created in Excel
- Data visualizations and business insights using Power BI

Each project reflects a new concept or technique I’ve learned, from writing efficient SQL queries and building logic-based Excel dashboards to designing impactful visuals that support data-driven decisions.

Whether you're a recruiter, collaborator, or fellow data enthusiast, I hope my work here provides a clear view of my journey and capabilities.
